It is not just that insufficiently competent readers refrain, as they should, 
from passing judgment on what they don’t understand. All too often, what readers 
do is judge profound what they have failed to grasp. Obscurity inspires awe, a 
fact I have been only too aware of, living as I have been in the Paris of

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">There are 
two ways of holding beliefs in one’s mind. Holding a belief may be 
experienced—to the extent that it is experienced at all—as plain awareness of a 
fact, without awareness of reasons to take it to be a fact. So are held most of 
our ordinary beliefs. They are delivered by our spontaneous cognitive processes, 
the reliability of which we take for granted without examination. I believe that 
it is sunny because I see that it is; I believe that it rained yesterday because 
I remember that it did; and I believe that you are in a good mood because this 
is how I spontaneously interpret the expression on your face. Here, “because” 
introduces not reasons I might have weighted in forming these beliefs, but the 
causal processes through which I come to have them. Such beliefs are “intuitive” 
in the sense that they impose themselves on us without our being aware of the 
process through which they do so.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Other 
beliefs I hold because I also believe there is a good reason to hold them. I 
believe that it will be sunny tomorrow because so said the weather report, and I 
find its next-day predictions reliable enough. I believe that you just made up 
with your friend on the phone because this is the best explanation I can find 
for your suddenly improved mood. In these cases, “because” introduces a reason 
for my belief. Such beliefs are “reflective” in the sense that we entertain them 
together with the reasons we have to accept them.<A title=""

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Entertaining a reason is as much a cognitive 
process as is perceiving, remembering or mood-sensing. Conversely, the fact that 
perception, memory and mood-sensing are reliable cognitive processes would give 
us a reason, if we cared for one, to accept the beliefs they generate. The 
contrast I want to draw between “reflective” and “intuitive beliefs” is not 
between beliefs held because of a cause and beliefs held because of a reason, 
but between beliefs held with or without <I>mentally represented</I> 
reasons.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

that is, have to do with the <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">content</I>

which this proposition follows. Such an argument may be based on evidence: I 
believe that <SPAN style="COLOR: black">the cake in the oven is properly baked 
because the knife blade I inserted in it came out dry. The argument may be 
purely formal: I believe that there is no greatest prime number because, given 
any prime number however large, I know how a prime number greater than this one 
can be computed.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: 318.95pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB

“external,” that is, have to do with the <I

what I have been told or what I read because I judge the source to be reliable. 
I believe my friend Mary will come to diner tonight because she said she would 
and I trust her. I believe that there are tensions between the President and the 
Prime Minister because so says <I>Le Monde</I>, a newspaper I find reliable on 
such issues. Catholics believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are 
one because they trust the priests who tell them so.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="tab-stops: 318.95pt"><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The belief that a friend, the newspaper or the 
priest is trustworthy may itself be held intuitively or reflectively. I 
intuitively trust my friend Mary, without having ever reflected on her 
trustworthiness. When, on the other hand, a belief in a source’s trustworthiness 
is held in a reflective manner, it may, just as other reflective beliefs, be 
based on internal reasons having to do with the content of the belief or on 
external reasons having to do with the source of the belief. Christian children 
may believe the priest is trustworthy because their parents (whom they trust 
intuitively) told them he is—an external reason. I believe that <I>Le Monde</I> 
is, on the whole, trustworthy because I have had much direct evidence of this 
trustworthiness—an internal reason.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We may 
initially accept a person’s authority on the basis of her reputation—an external 
reason—, and then update our degree of trust on the basis of her record—an 
internal reason. I first went to doctor Z because she was warmly recommended to 
me. Now I keep going—and I myself recommend her to others—because, in my 
experience, her diagnoses and advice have been confirmed, and have heightened my 
confidence in her.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

the psychological literature on reasoning, is known as a “confirmation bias”<A

style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-language: FR; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-special-character: footnote">[3]</SPAN></A>: 
under some conditions, confidence in their beliefs cause believers to pay more 
attention to confirming than disconfirming evidence, thereby increasing their 
initial confidence. Internal evidence of trustworthiness is typically 
interpreted on the basis of prior trust. I followed doctor Z’s prescription and 
got well in a week when I had hoped to be cured in three or four days. Still, I 
trust her and take the fact that I was cured as further evidence of her 
trustworthiness. If my trust in doctor Z had been wavering, I might have taken 
the fact that it took me a whole week to get well when it seemed reasonable to 
hope for a more rapid recovery as a reason to question doctor Z’s 
trustworthiness.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">The more 
the evidence is open to a variety of construals, the greater the risk of a 
confirmation bias. Few things better lend themselves to divergent construals 
than obscure statements. It is not surprising then often to find that their 
interpretation is strongly biased by the prior authority granted to their 
source. Divination practices around the world provide the best illustrations of 
this kind of interpretive charity: consultants interpret pithy statements—and 
the Pithia’s own, in her time—in a way that is relevant to them and confirms the 
powers they attribute to the diviner:<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 6pt 0cm; TEXT-INDENT: 0cm"><I><SPAN lang=EN-GB

about are in pain…<BR><I>Consultant</I>: Amazing! Yes, everybody was sick after 
Thanksgiving, and the guy who sold me the turkey was very tall indeed.<O:P> 
</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Interpretive charity is not, however, an odd 
departure from normal interpretive practices, and not only pithy statements but 
all utterances leave room for interpretation. Quite generally, sentences vastly 
underdetermine their interpretation. Typically, they contain referring 
expressions the referent of which is not linguistically determined, they are 
multiply ambiguous, and they are open to a whole range of construals going from 
literal, to loose, to figurative. An utterance never fully encodes the speaker’s 
meaning. Rather, it provides a richly structured piece of evidence from which 
the hearer (or the reader) can infer the speaker’s (or the writer’s) meaning. In 
this inferential process, hearers are helped by considerations of relevance. 
Utterances raise expectations of relevance that guide the comprehension process 
towards an interpretation that satisfies these expectations.<A title=""

So, for instance, if John arriving late tells me, “I missed the bus,” I 
understand him to refer to the bus that could have brought him in time, and to 
mean “miss” in the sense of <I>fail to arrive in time to board</I> and not of 
<I>feel sad about the absence of</I>, of <I>fail to hit with a projectile</I>. 
In fact, typically, I home in on the contextually relevant interpretation 
without being aware of alternatives.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">We expect 
what people tell us to be relevant, and we interpret it in a way that confirms 
this expectation. To the extent that speaker themselves expect us to home in on 
an optimally relevant interpretation of their utterances and produces utterances 
the optimally relevant interpretation of which is the very one they intended, 
what could be seen as an instance of the confirmation bias is, in this case, a 
rational way to achieve coordination and understanding.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Relevance 
itself has two aspects: everything else being equal, the greater the cognitive 
effects derived from the processing of an utterance (or, for that matter, any 
other type of information), the greater its relevance. For instance, if you want 
to know at what time is the next train to Manchester, it would be more relevant 
for you to be told “it is at 5:16” than to be told “it is sometimes after 5.” 
The more precise statement not only entails all the consequences of the vaguer 
one, but it also entails further consequences that you are likely to pay 
attention to: more cognitive effect, more relevance. The second aspect of 
relevance has to do not with cognitive effect but with processing effort. 
Everything else being equal, the greater the effort needed to process an 
utterance, the <I>lesser</I> its relevance. It would be more relevant for you to 
be told of the next train to Manchester, “it is at 5:16” than to be told, “it is 
twenty-two minutes after 4:54” (unless, of course, the lapse between 4:54 and 
the departure of the train is of special relevance to you) although the two 
statements are synonymous and carry exactly the same consequences. The second, 
more convoluted statement requires greater processing effort: more effort, less 
relevance.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">So, we 
expect what we are told or what we read to be relevant, that is, to carry 
sufficient effect to be worth our attention and to do so without causing us 
unnecessary effort of comprehension. Of course, speakers or writers tend to 
overestimate the relevance of what they have to say, and hearers’ or readers’ 
expectations of relevance are frequently disappointed. In particular, when 
people of no particular authority express their thoughts in an obscure manner, 
we often revise down our already moderate expectations of relevance to a level 
where trying to make sense of what they say is not even worth the effort. On the 
other hand, when we trust that what we are told is relevant, the fact that some 
stretch of discourse or text requires more effort leads to the expectation it 
will carry more effect (extra effort being a price paid for extra effect, thus 
maintaining the overall level of relevance). <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In fact, 
departing from plain and easy formulation is often a way of signalling that 
something other than plain meaning is intended. I cannot resist using a famous

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In other

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">As children 
we were often told things that we didn’t quite understand but were clearly 
intended to. Little Lucy is told by her teacher that cucumbers are 95% water (an 
example I borrow from Andrew Woodfield). She thinks of water as a liquid. Now, 
cucumbers are solid, not liquid objects; water does not flow out of them; so 
what could the teacher mean? Accepting, however, the authority of the teacher, 
Lucy now believes, without fully understanding it, that, somehow, cucumbers are 
95% water. The very difficulty of grasping this idea indicates to her that this 
is a relevant piece of information, worth remembering and thinking about until 
she can make better sense of it.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Lucy was 
also told by her parents and at Sunday school that God is everywhere. This too 
she believes with only partial comprehension. Whereas many children end up 
understanding how solid bodies such as cucumbers can mostly be made of water, 
the belief that God is everywhere remains impossible to fully comprehend. This 
mysteriousness is, if anything, even better recognized by theologians than by 
children. Given that, for the faithful, the relevance of the belief is beyond 
question, its very mysteriousness is a strong indication of its significance. 
Impenetrability indicates profundity.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">In front of 
religious mysteries (divine omnipresence, the Trinity), believers stand in awe. 
They may derive some relatively unproblematic consequences from these beliefs 
(e.g., divine omnipresence implies that there is no place to hide from God) but 
it takes theologians to aim at sophisticated interpretations that, anyhow, are 
never final. For most believers, the existence of mysteries is, in fact, more 
relevant than their actual content. Because of the authority they grant 
religion, believers are convinced that the content of mysteries would be 
extraordinarily relevant to them if only they could grasp it. The fragmentary 
interpretations of mysteries that lay and clerical believers arrive at are 
wholly guided by this certainty of relevance. The existence of barely glimpsed 
hyper-relevant content is yet another confirmation of the supreme authority of 
religion.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

am trying to illustrate is independent of the quality and clarity of what the 
authors had in mind when writing these passages. Maybe, each and every one of 
them had in mind an important thought that could not be expressed in any simpler 
way. Maybe some readers (including, possibly readers of the present essay) have 
grasped these thoughts and been illuminated by them. The fact is that, for most 
if not all readers, the interpretation of such statements is highly problematic. 
Still, the very effort required tends to be seen as an indication of high 
relevance and to favour interpretations consistent with this indication. If they 
cannot come to any clear and plausible interpretation, readers may nevertheless 
seek fragmentary and tentative interpretive hypotheses that go in the expected 
direction. Even if these statements remain hopelessly opaque, readers may take 
their very opacity as evidence of their depth.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>

expression. With a prior high confidence in the intellectual worth of the 
author, negative judgment is almost ruled out and depth can be inferred, even if 
no satisfactory interpretation of the statement in question is ever arrived at. 
Prior appreciation of an author justifies a positive construal of difficult 
passage. So far, so good. Things may go wrong if, in a viciously circular

The logical force of an argument does not depend on the authority of whoever

convincing all the same. While there is no sure way to tell by mere inspection a 
true statement from a false one (unless the false statement is 
self-contradictory or contradicts what is already known to be true), competent

and argumentation seem to be two quite different paths to persuasion, and, to a 
large extent, they are. From an evolutionary point of view, the capacity to 
produce and evaluate arguments might have emerged as a way of partially 
overcoming the risk of deception and manipulation involved in accepting the 
authority of communicators.<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5"

Historically, the transition to modernity can be described as the replacement of 
authority by argument as the main basis of justified beliefs. In intellectual 
style, there is often a clear opposition between those who trust more authority 
than argument, and those who trust more argument than authority. Nevertheless, 
in communicative practices, what we find is not a dichotomy between appeal to 
authority and appeal to reason, but a variety of interactions and overlaps 
between the two forms.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">To begin 
with, trivially, authority can be argued for. For instance, in John, 14: 11, 
Jesus says: “Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in 
me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.” Jesus gives 
a reason to accept his authority to those who would not spontaneously do 
so.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">More 
interestingly, trust in authority may give us a reason to accept the validity of 
an argument without examining its steps, or even without quite comprehending it. 
Bobby fails to understand the math teacher’s demonstration that there is no 
greatest prime number, but the very fact that the teacher presents what she 
claims is a proof causes Bobby to accept as a proven fact that there is no 
greatest prime number—and he is right, of course! This extends to 
non-demonstrative arguments. For example, people looking for an effective weight 
loss program may stumble on the following argument: “Where is the scientific 
evidence that eating the controlled carb way is healthy? By adhering to a 
controlled carbohydrate nutritional approach, an individual who chooses to eat 
nutrient-dense foods … is more likely to meet his nutritional needs, promoting 
good health, than he would by following a calorie-restricted, fat-deficient 
diet. … For studies that support the health benefits of a controlled 
carbohydrate nutritional approach, <U>click here</U>. All these studies confirm 
that not only is controlling carbohydrate consumption effective, it actually 
results in improved health parameters” (http://atkins.com). Even if they do not 
fully comprehend the argument or are not able to weigh its force and cannot be 
bothered to click and look at the additional evidence proposed, people may be 
swayed by the fact that what looks like a forceful argument is being put forward 
for their consideration.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Suppose 
that you accept on trust some argument of mine as valid and its premises as 
true. Then, of course, you also will accept as true the conclusion of the 
argument. Given however that you are just relying on my authority, should the 
fact that I have argued for this conclusion give you a better reason to accept 
it than if I has merely asserted it? After all, if you are willing to take my 
word for the soundness of an argument, why not just take it directly for the 
truth of its conclusion? Well, the very fact that I produced an argument, even 
if you are unable to assess its validity, or cannot be bothered, is of relevance 
to the evaluation of its conclusion. To argue is to make an effort in order to 
appeal to one’s audience’s reason. It can be seen as a mark of respect for one’s 
audience (just as to refuse to argue is a mark of disrespect). A valid argument 
is harder to fake than a true statement. To argue is to expose oneself to 
critical examination. So, the very fact that I made the effort and took the risk 
involved in arguing may contribute to the believability of my conclusion, even 
if the argument remains unexamined.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">When paying 
with a check, you may offer to present some identification: sometimes, this very 
offer will be seen as evidence of your trustworthiness and will be declined just 
because it was made, while, if not spontaneously offered, identification would 
have been requested. Of course, swindlers know this too and can use apparent 
forthrightness to achieve devious goals. Similarly, the apparently honest 
display of argumentation can be used to impress, browbeat, or even deceive one’s 
audience, and had been developed as a rhetorical technique by the Sophists 
depicted in Platonic dialogues.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">My interest 
here, however, is in honest rather than dishonest gurus. Honest gurus are not 
trying to deceive their audience. Nevertheless, they may produce arguments that 
will persuade most of their readers not by their logical force, but by their 
very difficulty. A recent illustration is provided by <I>The Emperor’s New 
Mind</I> by the eminent physicist Roger Penrose. As summarized by the blurb of 
the book, Penrose “argues that there are facets of human thinking, of human 
imagination, that can never be emulated by a machine. Exploring a dazzling array 
of topics—complex numbers, black holes, entropy, quasicrystals, the structure of 
the brain, and the physical processes of consciousness—Penrose 
<I>demonstrates</I> that laws even more wondrously complex than those of quantum 
mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind” (my italics). Given the 
wealth of premises from different fields of knowledge and the complexity of the 
argument, I doubt that most readers are in a position to evaluate what, if 
anything, Penrose demonstrates. Still, coming from such an authoritative source, 
the very elaborateness of the argument is enough to suggest that it can 
withstand a level of scrutiny that most readers would be quite unable to 
provide, and that Penrose is offering a hard-to-grasp but plausible and highly 
relevant perspective on the relationship between fundamental physics and human 
psychology.<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6"

<H3><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Runaway trust in 
authority<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></H3>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">A possible 
explanation of the obscurity of a statement made by an authoritative source may 
be that it expresses some important thought that could not be formulated in a 
simpler way. Similarly, a possible explanation of the difficulty of an argument 
may be that there is no simpler way to justify its conclusion. When my only 
alternative is to question the otherwise well-established authority of the 
source just because I have trouble understanding it, these explanations may be 
the best I can come up with, and, if so, I should accept them. Such “inferences 
to the best explanation” may in turn justify my accepting a statement as true or 
an argument as valid, even though I don’t quite understand them. On the other 
hand, how could my failure to fully understand a statement or an argument ever 
justify me in granting even more authority to its source? Obscurity need not be 
held against an author—after all, it may just reflect the limits of my own 
understanding—, but how could it be held in her favour? An obvious risk in 
upgrading the authority of a source because of the obscurity of its 
pronouncements is that of running into the vicious circle I mentioned: the 
favourable interpretation I give of an obscure text is based on the prior 
authority I grant its source; if I then use this interpretation to value up this 
authority, and then this enhanced authority to interpret even more favourably 
the next obscure text from the same source, a string of obscure texts (or, for 
that matter, reinterpretations of just one of them) might cause me to grant 
near-absolute authority to a source just because I don’t understand it. Are 
individuals <I>on their own</I> predisposed to commit this kind of fallacy? I 
see no reason to believe they are, or at least, not systematically. On the other 
hand something of the sort happens in the collective recognition of 
authorities.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Authority 
is social relationship that involves at least two individuals, and typically 
many more. Authority in a group goes with reputation. The reputation of a person 
is the more or less consensual view of her competence and reliability that 
spreads through repeated acts of communication across a social group. 
Individuals may just state that So-and-so is knowledgeable or wise, or they may 
give examples of this knowledge and wisdom. They may also discuss the 
interpretation and the value of specific pronouncements. Clear statements and 
easy arguments may become the objects of a collective evaluation, but only 
obscure statements and difficult arguments are likely to become the objects of a 
collective endeavour of interpretation.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">As long as 
the interpretation of a text is not settled, its evaluation is likely to be 
based on external rather than internal criteria. We don’t know what X meant in 
making some obscure statement, but, given the authority we recognise him, we 
have reasons to think that he was expressing a very important idea. In fact, if 
we did not think this, we would not be involved in trying to comprehend that 
statement. Participating in a collective process of interpretation amounts to 
publicly vouching for the value of what is being interpreted. Moreover, it <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">seems</I> sensible to take the amount of 
attention paid to thinkers and their thought as a rough indication of their 
importance—and it <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">would</I> be sensible 
if it were not for the fact that these individual evaluations build on one 
another and together spiral into ever greater devotion.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Participants in a collective process of 
interpretation have a double stake in the value of the text they are working on 
and in the authority of its author. The greater this value and this authority, 
the more they are justified in joining the process, and the less the tentative 
and partial character of their interpretations can be seen as a negative 
reflection on their own intellectual abilities. Moreover, participating in such 
a collective process involves not just an intellectual but also— and more 
surely— a social benefit, that of belonging, of getting recognition as a person 
in the know, capable of appreciating the importance of a difficult great 
thinker. Not participating, on the other hand, may involve the cost of being 
marginalised and of appearing intellectually stale and flat.<O:P> 
</O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Here 
emerges a collective dynamics typical of intellectual schools and sects, where 
the obscurity of respected masters is not just a sign of the depth of their 
thinking, but a proof of their genius. Left on their own, admiring readers 
interprets one recondite passage after another in a way that may slowly 
reinforces their admiration (or else render them wary). Now sharing their 
interpretations and impressions with other admirers, readers find in the 
admiration, in the trust that other have for the master, reasons to consider 
their own interpretations as failing to do justice to the genius of the 
interpreted text. In turn these readers become disciples and proselytes. Where 
we had the slow back-and-forth of solitary reading between favourable 
interpretation and increased confidence in authority, now we have a competition 
among disciples for an interpretation that best displays the genius of the 
master, an interpretation that, for this purpose, may be just as obscure as the 
thought it is meant to interpret. Thus a thinker is made into a guru and her 
best disciples in gurus-apprentices.<O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Unlike the 
people in Andersen’s tale pretending to admire the emperor’s non-existent 
clothes, participants in the collective dynamics of guruification need not be, 
and generally are not in bad faith: they have strong external reasons for their 
appreciation—reasons that they provide one another—, which in turn lead them to 
favourable interpretations that provide them with further internal reasons. 
Moreover they need not even be wrong: human intellectual history is full of 
challenging propositions and arguments that turned out to be true and important.
