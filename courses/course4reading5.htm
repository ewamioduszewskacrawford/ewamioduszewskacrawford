      <P>All of us humans speak and understand at least one language, English 
      for instance. How intelligent we are! Well, how intelligent are we? Is 
      mastery of a language truly proof of intelligence?</P>
      <P>I take it that intelligence, like beauty, is a property rather than a 
      thing. There is no area of a brain that might properly be called its 
      intelligence. On the other hand, a variety of doings and doers can be 
      called intelligent. Though there probably isn't a satisfactory definition, 
      typical instances of intelligent doings are not too hard to characterize. 
      They involve creative reasoning achieved by bringing together various 
      informations (for instance new and old informations) on the basis of which 
      novel conclusions, insights, or decisions can be reached. More 
      technically, we happily describe as intelligent inferential processes that 
      are not entirely "data-driven." If a process isn't at all inferential, or 
      if it is an automatic reaction to a specific stimulus, then talk of 
      intelligence is much less apropriate.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the doubts that surround the very notion of 
      intelligence, the view that human language is proof of human intelligence 
      may well be the oldest and most common philosophical cliché. Here is 
      today's quote:</P>

      <DIR>
      <P>As the soft lips and pliant tongue are taught<BR>With other minds to

      conceptions of external things<BR>The facile power of Recollection

      brute, and man from man divides</P>

      <P>The claim that linguistic behaviour shows human superior intelligence 
      can be taken in three ways. It may be the things we say: our words give 
      evidence of our thoughts, and the soundness and creativity of our thoughts 
      show how intelligent we are.</P>
      <P>It may also be argued that, without linguistic communication, there 
      would be no literature, no science, no law, in a nutshell, no cumulative 
      building of knowledge, theoretical or practical. Now the cultural 
      transmission of knowledge, the Darwin Lectures for instance, no doubt 
      contributes greatly to the development of individual intelligence. These 
      two lines of argument have been soundly and creatively pursued by Daniel 
      Dennett in his contribution to this volume, and I won't consider them 
      further here.</P>
      <P>According to a third line of argument, nothing better establishes our 
      intelligence than the very existence of verbal communication, whatever we 
      say. As Descartes argued, even fools saying foolish things display a form 
      of intelligence that no other animal possesses. The very ambiguity of the 
      word "understanding," meaning both intelligence and comprehension, is, in 
      this respect, quite telling. This view of the relationship between 
      language and intelligence, however, doesn't square too well with an even 
      more common view, according to which verbal communication is a matter of 
      coding and decoding. For are coding and decoding truly intelligent 
      activities?</P><B>
      <P>Coding and its limits</P></B>
      <P>What do we do when we communicate? What cognitive skill do we thereby 
      exhibit? The common view is that communication is possible just in case 
      interlocutors share a code. A language such as English is seen as a 
      complex code. Whether simple or complex, a code is a device that generates 
      pairs made up of a message and a signal: the Morse code, for instance 
      pairs each letter of the alphabet with a series of short or long beeps; a 
      language pairs linguistic senses and sounds. The pairing of messages and 
      signals generated by the code can be made to work in two kinds of devices: 
      encoders and decoders.</P>
      <P>Humans can perform both as encoders of linguistic senses and as 
      decoders of linguistic sound, and that, so the story goes, is how they 
      communicate with one another. Failures of communication occur when 
      encoding or decoding isn't done properly, or when noise damages the sound 
      signal, or, more significantly, when the codes of the interlocutors are 
      not properly matched. Otherwise, such code-based communication is sure to 
      run smoothly. This is a simple and powerful explanation of the successes 
      and failures of communication. However, if this explanation is correct, 
      then the ability to communicate linguistically shouldn't be described as 
      intelligent at all.</P>
      <P>The work of an encoding or decoding device is neither inferential nor 
      creative. It is not inferential because the symmetrical relation between a 
      message and a signal is quite different from the asymmetrical relation of 
      premise to conclusion: just as the letter "m" does not logically follow 
      from two long beeps, the meaning of a sentence does not logically follow 
      from its sound. The work of an encoding or decoding device is not creative 
      either: it is an automatic reaction to the input message or signal. 
      Actually, it had better <I>not</I> be creative: a creative bout at the 
      encoding or decoding end would jeopardize the symmetry between the two 
      processes and hence the success of code-based communication.</P>
      <P>However, the common view of verbal communication is false and, as I 
      will try to show, coding and decoding are just ancillary components of 
      what is essentially a creative inferential process.</P>
      <P>Take an ordinary sentence such as:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>It's late</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>As an English speaker, you know, don't you, what this means? In a 
      situation where you wanted to convey that meaning to another English 
      speaker, you would say "It's late" and be understood, and that's all there 
      is to it. Or is it?</P>
      <P>To begin with, in saying "It's late" you might intend to convey not 
      just the explicit information that it is late, but also something 
      implicit: say, that it is time to go home. The existence of such implicit 
      content has long been recognised, and its study, inspired by the work of 
      the philosopher Paul Grice, has become the main focus of pragmatics. Not 
      everything that is communicated is wholly encoded: that much is generally 
      agreed. I would like to make a stronger claim: nothing that is 
      communicated is wholly encoded. In other words, even the explicit part of 
      communication is never fully explicit, not by a wide margin, actually.</P>
      <P>Consider the following dialogue:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR><I>
      <P>Peter</I>: When does the train arrive?<BR><I>Mary</I>: It's 
      late!</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Here Mary is using "It's late" in a meaning different from the one you 
      probably had in mind a minute ago. Whereas in the earlier utterance, the 
      "it" did not refer to anything at all and was just a syntactic filler, in 
      Mary's utterance, the "it" refers to the train. In yet other utterances of 
      the same sentence, "it" might refer to an apology, a payment, a chemical 
      reaction, or whatnot. Analysing the word "it" in the hope of finding out 
      what, if anything, it refers to would be as unhelpful as staring at a 
      pointed finger in the hope of finding out what, if anything, it is 
      pointing at. What must be taken into consideration in order to determine 
      what "it" may refer to is, of course, the context.</P>
      <P>An utterance must be taken together with a context. How is that done? 
      It is often supposed that there must exist some system of rules that 
      applies to an utterance and its context taken together, to yield the 
      intended interpretation. However, this presupposes that the context is 
      somehow given and, together with the utterance itself, provides well 
      circumscribed initial data for the interpretation process. This 
      presupposition is quite mistaken.</P>
      <P>"It's late," taken without contextual information, suggests that the 
      "it" is a syntactic filler without a referent. Knowing just that "It's 
      late" was a reply to the question: "When does the train arrive?" suggests 
      that "it" referred to the train. But further contextual information might 
      reverse this interpretation:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR><I>
      <P>Mary</I>: I'm tired. I want to go home. We don't even know 
      that<BR>Johnny will be on the train.<BR><I>Peter</I>: When does the train 
      arrive?<BR><I>Mary</I>: It's late! Forget the train! Let's go 
      home!</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Here, the "it" in "It's late" is once more the usual syntactic filler. 
      Further contextualisations would again reverse the preferred 
      interpretation. As such examples show, the context is not a given on the 
      basis of which comprehension might proceed. Rather, deciding what 
      constitutes the pertinent context is part and parcel of the interpretation 
      process.</P>
      <P>Whether "it" refers, and to what, is by no means the only source of 
      indeterminacy in "It's late." Nothing is late in and of itself. To be late 
      is to be late with respect to some expectation, schedule or timetable. 
      But, of course, several such schedules may enter into consideration. Even 
      referring to specific objects such as trains doesn't determine a single 
      relevant schedule. Thus, I might say</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>The late train to Cambrige is hardly ever 
      late</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>without contradicting myself: my two uses of "late" would merely relate 
      to two different schedules: lateness in the day and lateness on departure 
      or on arrival. Deciding which schedule is intended by the speaker again 
      depends on a context that must be discovered as part of the interpretation 
      process.</P>
      <P>Suppose, however, that we know that "it" refers to the train to 
      Cambridge, and that the train is said to be late with respect to its 
      expected time of arrival, 5:25 p.m.. Surely, in that case, we know what 
      "It's late" means. Or do we? Here we are, let us imagine, on the platform 
      at Cambridge railway station at 5:20. Three people are about to utter the 
      same sentence, "It's late," referring to the same train and with the same 
      schedule in mind and yet they will mean quite different things.</P>
      <P>First Peter, who believes the worst of British Railways, asserts at 
      5:21:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR><I>
      <P>Peter</I>: No doubt it's late again!</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>However at 5:24 the train is heard, and Mary says to Peter:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR><I>
      <P>Mary</I>: You're a real seer! Indeed it's 
      late!</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Our third character is a railway controller looking at his stopwatch. 
      He sees that the train stops at 5:26, and says sternly:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR><I>
      <P>The controller</I>: It's late!</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Peter and the controller are speaking in earnest, while Mary is 
      speaking ironically. Peter and Mary use "late" rather loosely, while the 
      controller uses it so strictly as to see sixty seconds late as late enough 
      to mention. Because of these subtle differences, their three utterances, 
      though the words, the train, and the schedule are the same, convey quite 
      different thoughts.</P>
      <P>Yes, as an English speaker, you know the linguistic sense, or rather 
      senses, of "It's late," but these senses are very incomplete affairs; they 
      are not, by themselves, the meanings you might want to convey when you 
      utter the words. As a hearer too, merely knowing the linguistic senses of 
      "It's late" does not tell you what a speaker means in uttering these 
      words. The same is true of every sentence in every human language: the 
      thought we intend to convey can never be fully encoded, and linguistic 
      decoding is only a first step in understanding a speaker's meaning.</P>
      <P>Going from linguistic sense to speaker's meaning is not a matter of 
      further decoding, not even of context-sensitive decoding: it is a matter 
      of inference. What then is the form of inference involved in verbal 
      understanding?</P><B>
      <P>Inference</P></B>
      <P>In any instance of verbal understanding, there is an initial premise 
      and a goal. The premise is the information that a certain person uttered a 
      certain sentence. The goal is to discover what that person meant in 
      uttering that sentence. The premise and the conclusion of a succesful 
      comprehension process are both complex in the same way, but not to the 
      same degree.</P>
      <P>The first premise in comprehension might be something like this:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>Carol says: "It's late"</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>The conclusion might be something like this:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>Carol means that it is time to go home</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Here, premise and conclusion both involve a "meta-representation": that 
      is, they contain a representation of a representation. The premise is 
      about an utterance ("It's late") and directly quotes that utterance. The 
      conclusion is about a thought (that it is time to go home) and indirectly 
      quotes that thought. On closer analysis, however, it turns out that while 
      the premise is a first-order meta-representation, the conclusion is a 
      higher-order meta-representation.</P>
      <P>Just like the attribution of an utterance, the attribution of a belief, 
      for instance</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>Carol believes that it is time to go home,</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>may be a simple meta-representational affair. There is an important 
      relationship between meaning and believing but it is not a simple one.</P>
      <P>When John concludes that, in saying "It's late," Carol means that it is 
      time to go home, he need not at all attribute to her the belief that it is 
      time to go home: after all, she might be insincere and attempting to 
      communicate what she does not believe. What John must be attributing to 
      Carol is an intention rather than a belief: the intention that <I>he</I> 
      should believe that it is time to go home.</P>
      <P>An intention is a mental representation of a desired state of affairs. 
      What state of affairs does a speaker desire? A state of affairs in which 
      some information becomes represented in her hearer's mind as a result of 
      her utterance. We call such intentions "informative intentions." Simple 
      informative intentions are first-order meta-representations. Thus the 
      content of Carol's intention is the following meta-representation (I will 
      use different lines and indents to separate the different representational 
      levels):</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>John should believe</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>that it is time to go home</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>Thinking that someone has an informative intention is entertaining a 
      second-order meta-represention. Thus John's understanding of Carol's 
      utterance contains the following second-order meta-representation:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>She intends</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>me to believe</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>that it is time to go 
      home</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>I will argue later that full-fledged comprehension involves reaching a 
      more complex conclusion than this. It is plausible, however, that young 
      children at a certain stage in communicative development do not go beyond 
      such second-order meta-representations and that adults too do not 
      systematically attend to the further meta-representational tiers involved 
      in communication. Still, reaching this already complex attribution of an 
      informative intention may, in many cases, provide adequate understanding, 
      as I will now describe.</P>
      <P>Going from the premise:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>Carol says: "It's late"</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>to the conclusion:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>She intends me to believe that it is time to go 
      home,</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>is a case of inductive inference. The conclusion goes beyond the 
      information contained in the premise in two respects: it goes from the 
      ambiguous and incomplete linguistic sense of "It's late" to the 
      proposition that it is time to go home; and it goes from first-degree 
      meta-representational attribution of an utterance to second-degree 
      meta-representational attribution of an informative intention.</P>
      <P>Let us look first at the meta-representational aspect. Whereas the 
      initial premise of this inductive inference merely attributes a behaviour 
      to the speaker, namely the production of a certain utterance, the 
      conclusion attributes an intention to her. Computers are coming close to 
      being able to recognise a speaker's utterance, and that is of course a 
      remarkable achievement. However, recognising a speaker's intentions 
      requires far more intelligence than computers have been equipped with so 
      far.</P>
      <P>In general, behaviours can be conceptualised as bodily movements or as 
      realising intentions. Conceptualising voluntary behaviours as realising 
      intentions is far more economical, more explanatory, and of greater 
      predictive value than merely conceptualising them as bodily movements. 
      However, in order to conceptualise behaviours in terms of underlying 
      intentions, an organism needs the ability to entertain 
      meta-representations. Very few animals have any meta-representational 
      ability. There is some experimental and anecdotal evidence suggesting that 
      chimpanzees and possibly other non-human primates do possess some such 
      ability in a rudimentary form.</P>
      <P>What about humans? Do they have a meta-representational ability? Do 
      birds fly? Do fish swim? Humans can no more refrain from attributing 
      intentions than they can from batting their eyelids. The only issue 
      regarding humans is developmental: at what age and through what stages do 
      meta-representational abilities develop, if they are not there from the 
      start? There is plenty of current research on the issue, much of it 
      assuming that the ability to attribute beliefs and intentions appears well 
      after the development of rich verbal abilities. I should point out that 
      this is inconsistent with the picture of verbal understanding that I am 
      proposing here. If the picture I am presenting is correct, some ability to 
      attribute intentions precedes the ability to communicate verbally.</P>
      <P>How are intentions identified? In many cases, the attribution of a 
      specific intention involves a simple pattern of inference: the behaviour 
      of an individual is observed to have a certain desirable effect; the 
      individual is assumed to have intended this very effect. A man shoots an 
      arrow and kills a deer: an observer infers that it was the man's intention 
      to kill the deer. Though often successful, this pattern of inference will 
      sometimes fail: a behaviour may not achieve the intended effect; or a 
      behaviour may produce a desirable effect that had not been foreseen, and 
      therefore not been intended either. A more reliable inference pattern will 
      see as intentional not the actual desirable effect of a behaviour but an 
      effect that the agent may have seen as desirable and as made more probable 
      by his behaviour. Humans easily perform inferences of this more complex 
      kind: a man shoots an arrow and the arrow comes close to hitting a deer: 
      all the same, an observer has no trouble inferring that it was the man's 
      intention to kill the deer.</P>
      <P>Capable of attributing mental states to others, humans are also capable 
      of forming an intention to change those mental states. Peter wears the tie 
      that Mary has given him. A knowledgeable observer recognises Peter's 
      intention to please Mary. Bobby tiptoes to his mother and suddenly shouts 
      "Boo!" An observer recognises Bobby's intention to startle his mother.</P>
      <P>Consider a behaviour intended to change the mental state of an 
      individual, and imagine that that target individual herself observes this 
      behaviour and recognises the underlying intention. Will this affect the 
      chances of the intention being fulfilled? Well, it may sometime hinder, 
      and sometime help the fulfilment of the intention. If Bobby's mother sees 
      him coming and understand his intention to startle her, she won't be 
      startled. On the other hand, if Mary realises that Peter intends to please 
      her, she may be even more pleased.</P>
      <P>Informative intentions are typically helped by being recognised by the 
      intended audience. Communication in particular is a means of fulfilling an 
      informative intention by making one's audience recognise it.</P>
      <P>It is relatively easy to recognise a behaviour as intentionally 
      informative. Verbal and other communicative behaviours are typically 
      attention-catching, and they have to be. I can't communicate with you if 
      you don't pay attention. Verbal behaviour, moreoever, is largely 
      specialised for communication.</P>
      <P>Communicative behaviour also typically calls ideas to the mind of the 
      audience. This may be done by non-verbal as well as by verbal means. Carol 
      might establish eye contact with John, lean her head sideways, and close 
      her eyes for a second, in other words, she might mime falling asleep. This 
      would bring to John's mind the idea of sleep, or of Carol sleeping. Saying 
      to John "It's late" would, in the same situation, bring to his mind the 
      senses of the sentence, which all include some idea of lateness. In either 
      scenario, John would, at this point, recognise that Carol was intending to 
      inform him of something, but he would still have to discover what she 
      wanted to inform him of. The ideas she has brought to his mind fall quite 
      short of representing definite information.</P>
      <P>We have focused so far on the meta-representational dimension of 
      comprehension. We are now brought back to the semantic dimension: how does 
      John, for instance, go from the ambiguous and incomplete linguistic senses 
      of "It's late" to the well-understood proposition that it is time to go 
      home? I will describe three interpretation strategies that John might 
      adopt, a naive optimistic, a cautious optimistic, and a sophisticated 
      strategy.</P><B>
      <P>Naive optimism</P></B>
      <P>Suppose John is very trusting indeed and takes for granted that Carol 
      is behaving both benevolently and competently. Then John can take for 
      granted two further things: that the information Carol wants to convey to 
      him is information worth his attention, and that the means she is using to 
      convey that information should make it as easy as possible for him to 
      retrieve it.</P>
      <P>Deirdre Wilson and I have argued in our book <I>Relevance</I> that 
      information worth one's attention is information which brings about 
      significant cognitive effects, that is, information which, when taken 
      together with what the individual already knows or assumes, allows 
      inferences which would not have been possible otherwise. Such information 
      is <I>relevant</I>, and the greater the cognitive effects it brings about, 
      the more relevant it is. We have argued, on the other hand, that the 
      greater the mental effort needed to acquire and process relevant 
      information, the less relevant it is. This being so, when a hearer assumes 
      that a speaker is benevolent and competent, he can take for granted that 
      the information conveyed by her is relevant enough to be worth his 
      attention, and that retrieving it should not cause unnecessary effort, for 
      this would pointlessly diminish relevance.</P>
      <P>In particular, John may take for granted that the linguistic senses and 
      ideas that Carol's utterance has brought to his mind have not been evoked 
      in vain, and that they provide an optimal starting point for retrieving 
      the information Carol intended to convey. Given the situation and the way 
      in which these ideas have been evoked, one linguistic sense is more 
      salient than the others, some ways of fleshing it out it come more easily 
      to mind, some contextual information is more easily invoked, and thus the 
      possible interpretations are ranked in John's mind in order of ease of 
      access. In other situations, of course, the various possible 
      interpretations of the same utterance would be ranked differently.</P>
      <P>All John has to do now is follow the path of least effort in 
      constructing an interpretation of Carol's behaviour and stop when he 
      reaches an interpretation that provides him with information relevant 
      enough to be worth his attention. The interpretation he will reach in this 
      way will be the one intended by Carol. Why, you may ask, should the most 
      easily reached relevant interpretation be the true one? Why shouldn't the 
      true interpretation be arcane and utterly boring? From a logical point of 
      view, relevance and ease of access and have nothing to do with truth. From 
      a psychological point of view, however, the situation is different: a 
      competent and benevolent communicator will see to it that the information 
      she wants to convey is indeed relevant to her audience, and is more easily 
      retrieved than other otherwise plausible interpretations. So, the first 
      accessed, relevant enough interpretation is, by these very properties, 
      confirmed as the intended one.</P>
      <P>On hearing Carol say "It's late," John may not have any specific 
      referent for "it" that springs to mind, so the non-referring 
      interpretation of "it" would be favoured. The first interpretation of 
      "late" he can think of might be late with respect to the time at which 
      they had promised the baby-sitter to be back home. Together with easily 
      accessible contextual premises, for instance the knowledge that their 
      excellent baby-sitter might not come back if promises made to her are not 
      kept, Carol's utterance implies straightforwardly that it is time to go 
      home. This implication makes the utterance relevant enough, and therefore 
      John is led to conclude that Carol intends him to accept this implication, 
      that is, to believe that it is time to go home.</P>
      <P>The naive interpretation strategy I have just described will yield 
      adequate comprehension whenever the speaker is indeed benevolent and, 
      above all, competent enough to realise what is relevant and salient for 
      her audience at the time. However, speakers are not always that competent. 
      Suppose for instance that, unbeknownst to Carol, John has just been 
      worrying about a delivery that should have been made that very day. The 
      first relevant interpretation of Carol's utterance "It's late" to come to 
      John's mind might be that the delivery is late, and the simple inference 
      pattern I have described would cause him to accept -- wrongly -- that 
      interpretation as the intended one. Such errors of comprehensions do 
      occur. Young children in particular easily believe that one is talking 
      about what happens to be foremost in their mind (and conversely that what 
      they want to talk about is foremost in the minds of their listeners). 
      Still, most of the time, these errors are avoided. This suggests that 
      competent communicators have a more powerful interpretation strategy at 
      their disposal.</P><B>
      <P>Cautious optimism</P></B>
      <P>What this more powerful interpretation strategy might be is not too 
      hard to imagine. It is just a special case of competent attribution of 
      intentions. A competent observer can infer that the hunter intended to 
      kill the deer even though the arrow flew just over the animal. The 
      observer's inference pattern consists in seeing as intentional not the 
      actual effect of an action but an effect that the agent might have desired 
      and expected. Similarly, a more appropriate interpretation strategy in 
      matters of comprehension consists in attributing to the speaker an 
      interpretation that she might have thought would be relevant enough and 
      most easily accessed, rather than what actually happens to be the most 
      accessible relevant interpretation. In other words, a competent hearer 
      allows for the possibility that the speaker might have misjudged what 
      would be most accessible and relevant to him.</P>
      <P>I have now introduced two optimistic strategies: a naive and a more 
      cautious one. In the naive strategy, the speaker is assumed to be 
      benevolent and competent, and the inference pattern consists in going 
      uncritically where the ideas suggested by the linguistic sense of the 
      utterance will take you: look for easy relevance; assume that it was 
      intended. The conclusion of such an inference is a second-order 
      meta-representational attribution of a first-order meta-representational 
      intention. However, in that inference pattern, attributions of intentions 
      do not serve as premises. Their complex logical structure is derived but 
      not exploited.</P>
      <P>In the second, more cautious strategy, the speaker is assumed to be 
      benevolent, but not necessarily competent. She may not know what is on her 
      hearer's mind. She may therefore fail to convey relevant information, or 
      fail to make the relevant information she intends to convey more 
      accessible than any other possible interpretation. As in the naive 
      strategy, the hearer should follow the path of least effort, but he should 
      stop not at the first relevant enough interpretation that comes to mind, 
      but at the first interpretation that the speaker might have thought would 
      be relevant enough to him.</P>
      <P>Suppose the interpretation that first occur to the hearer is relevant 
      enough to him. His next step will be to evaluate this interpretation in 
      the light of what he knows about the speaker. Could she have expected this 
      interpretationto occur to him? Would she have seen it as relevant enough 
      to him? Only if the answer to both questions is yes will this 
      interpretation be retained. Otherwise, the next accessible interpretation 
      will be tested in the same way.</P>
      <P>This time, second-order meta-representations may serve not just as 
      conclusions, but also as premises. John may reject the conclusion that 
      Carol intends to inform him that the expected delivery is late, because he 
      believes that</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>she does not know</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>that I am wondering</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>whether the delivery took 
      place</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>He will then go to the next possible interpretation, the interpretation 
      on which it is time to go home. This second interpretation will pass the 
      evaluation test: yes, Carol could have expected it to occur to him and and 
      she may have found relevant it enough to be worth communicating. John, 
      using this inference pattern, will not be misled by his own obsession with 
      the possibly late delivery. He will understand Carol correctly.</P>
      <P>This second, cautious pattern of inference will yield adequate 
      comprehension whenever the speaker is benevolent, even though she might 
      not be competent enough to realise what is relevant and salient for her 
      audience at the time.</P>
      <P>But now let me tell you in confidence: speakers are not always 
      benevolent, and communication is not always a nice affair. I you doubt me, 
      just look at the amount of communicative energy spent on trying to 
      convince young people that smoking will make them glamorous! Very 
      competent, of course, but hardly benevolent. So, a truly sophisticated 
      hearer does not assume that every communicator is benevolent. And, for 
      that matter, a truly sophisticated communicator is not always 
      benevolent.</P>
      <P>Imagine the following scenario. The baby-sitter usually leaves at 
      midnight. This time, however, Carol, thinking that the party she and John 
      are invited to will be great fun, has asked the baby-sitter to stay until 
      one. Carol does not enjoy the party after all, but John does. At 11:30, 
      she says to him: "It's late," expecting him to think that it they have to 
      go home for the baby-sitter. Carol does not know that John knows about the 
      special arrangement she has made with the baby-sitter. Now, if John took 
      for granted that Carol was benevolent, he would be bound to misunderstand 
      her: she could not intend him to believe something she knows to be false 
      and that therefore does not constitute relevant information. He would then 
      look for another interpretation, and assume for instance that she means 
      late with respect to some other schedule or expectation.</P>
      <P>You might say: given what he knows, John will, in this case, drop the 
      assumption that Carol is benevolent. True enough, but very puzzling. 
      Remember that the two interpretation strategies I have described so far 
      both presuppose this very assumption. If John assumes that Carol is 
      benevolent, he will not find the right interpretation and he will have no 
      reason to doubt Carol's benevolence. If John drops this assumption he will 
      not find any interpretation at all. When you take benevolence for granted, 
      you cannot recognise bad faith or lies. When you don't take benevolence 
      for granted you cannot use optimistic interpretation strategies that 
      presuppose benevolence. Hearers who are capable of recognising lies must 
      be using yet another strategy.</P><B>
      <P>Sophisticated understanding</P></B>
      <P>Competent hearers (who are usually also competent speakers) realise 
      that speakers use communication to pursue their own ends, which may 
      correspond in some respects to the ends of their audience, and differ in 
      others.</P>
      <P>Communication is a special way of fulfilling an informative intention. 
      An informative intention can be fulfilled in many ways. One way is to 
      provide evidence, genuine or spurious, of the information one wants 
      someone to accept as true. Thus Carol might have pretended to fall asleep 
      at the party; John might be fooled by this behavior and come to believe 
      that it is time to go home, without ever realizing that this is exactly 
      what Carol intended him to believe.</P>
      <P>Another, often more practical way of fulfilling an informative 
      intention is to provide evidence for the fact that one has that very same 
      informative intention. Instead of pretending to fall genuinely asleep -- 
      and hurting her hosts' feelings as a side effect -- Carol might, as I 
      mentioned, mime falling asleep in a manifestly intentional way. This 
      ostensive behaviour would give John evidence of her intention: she 
      intends, by her behavior, to make him realise that it is time to go home. 
      John might well, as a result of grasping Carol's intention, end up 
      believing that it is time to go home. After all, if someone you trust 
      shows you that she wants you to believe something, then that gives you a 
      reason to believe it.</P>
      <P>Compare three ways in which Carol might try to convince John that it is 
      time to go home: she might deceitfully pretend to fall asleep; she might 
      overtly mime falling asleep, or she might say "It's late." In terms of 
      outward appearances, the deceitful pretence and the overt mime are much 
      more similar to one another than either is to the linguistic utterance. In 
      terms of procedure, however, the overt mime and the utterance fall 
      together. They both consist in trying to fulfil Carol's informative 
      intention by giving John genuine evidence of that very intention. The 
      deceitful pretence, on the other hand, stands alone; it consists in giving 
      false evidence of the information Carol wants John to accept, and no 
      evidence whatsoever of Carol's intention.</P>
      <P>To fulfil an informative intention by making it known is, properly 
      speaking, to communicate. Communication is not an accident that happens 
      when people have informative intentions and these informative intentions 
      somehow become known to their intended audience. Communication is 
      generally intentional. An intention to communicate, or, as we call it, a 
      "communicative intention," is a second-order informative intention: the 
      intention to make a first-order informative intention known. A simple 
      informative intention is a first order meta-representation. Knowing that 
      someone has an informative intention is entertaining a second-order 
      meta-represention. Having a communicative intention -- that is, intending 
      someone to know that one has an informative intention -- is entertaining a 
      third-order meta-representation. Attributing a communicative intention to 
      someone is therefore entertaining a fourth-order meta-representation. 
      Thus, if John is aware of Carol's intention, not just to cause him to 
      believe, but to <I>communicate</I> to him, that it is time to go home, 
      then he is entertaining a thought of the following complexity:</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>She intends</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>me to knowt</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>hat she intends</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>me to believe</P>
      <DIR>
      <DIR>
      <P>that it is time to go 
      home</P></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR></DIR>
      <P>When an agent is known to have some main intention, it can be inferred 
      that he also intends whatever he believes is necessary for his main 
      intention to be fulfilled. The hunter intending to kill the deer intends 
      his arrow to hit the deer in a vulnerable spot and with enough strength to 
      penetrate it.</P>
      <P>In the same way, when someone is known to have a communicative 
      intention, further intentions of hers become inferable. To have a 
      communicative intention is to hope to fulfil an informative intention by 
      making it known to one's audience. For this to succeed, there is an 
      obvious condition that must be fulfilled: the audience must believe that 
      the information the communicator wants to convey is relevant enough (and 
      is true to the extent that truth is necessary for relevance), or else the 
      audience won't pay attention, or won't accept the information as true. It 
      is manifest therefore, to communicator and audience alike, that the 
      communicator intends her audience to assume that what she intends to 
      communicate is relevant enough. In other words, every act of 
      communication, and in particular every utterance, conveys a presumption of 
      its own relevance. This universal fact is what we call <I>the principle of 
      relevance</I>.</P>
      <P>As I have argued, if a hearer can postulate that the speaker is 
      benevolent and competent, and therefore that her utterance is relevant to 
      him, then he has a good and simple interpretation pattern at his disposal. 
      However the initial postulate is often false. If a hearer can postulate 
      that the speaker is at least benevolent, and therefore that she believed 
      that her utterance would be relevant to him, he has a good, somewhat more 
      complex interpretation pattern at his disposal. However, this postulate 
      may still be false. If a hearer now attributes to the speaker a 
      full-fledged communicative intention, then he need not <I>postulate</I>, 
      he can <I>infer</I> that she intends her utterance to seem relevant to 
      him; if he is right in assuming that she is communicating to him, he 
      cannot be wrong in making this further assumption. Does this assumption 
      provide him with a good interpretation pattern? Yes it does.</P>
      <P>In the third, sophisticated strategy, the speaker is not assumed to be 
      benevolent or competent. She is merely assumed to intend to seem 
      benevolent and competent. The beauty is that now even if that intention 
      fails, interpretation may succeed. As in the other interpretation 
      strategies, the hearer should follow the path of least effort, but he 
      should stop, not at the first relevant enough interpretation that comes to 
      mind, nor at the first interpretation that the speaker might have thought 
      would be relevant enough to him, but at the first interpretation that the 
      speaker might have thought would <I>seem</I> relevant enough<I> </I>to 
      him.</P>
      <P>Suppose the first interpretation the hearer comes up with is not 
      relevant to him at all, because he knows that it is false, however it 
      would be relevant enough if were true. The hearer will evaluate this 
      interpretation: could the speaker have expected him to come up with it? 
      Would she have seen it as likely to seem relevant enough to him? If the 
      answer to both questions is yes, this interpretation will be retained. 
      Then the hearer may well wonder: did the speaker assume that this 
      interpretation would appear relevant to him because she herself believes 
      it is true and relevant, or was she trying to mislead him? Either way, the 
      speaker's <I>informative</I> intention will have failed: the hearer does 
      not accept the intended interpretation as true. But<I> the communicative 
      intention will have succeeded</I>: the hearer has correctly retrieved the 
      intended interpretation.</P>
      <P>Thus John will correctly understand that Carol intended him to believe 
      that it was time to go home because of the baby-sitter. However he will 
      disappoint Carol by not believing what she intended him to believe, and 
      moreover he will correctly recognise her disingenuousness.</P>
      <P>Full-fledged communicative competence involves, for the speaker, being 
      capable of having at least third-order meta-representational communicative 
      intentions, and, for the hearer, being capable of making at least 
      fourth-order meta-representational attributions of such communicative 
      intentions. In fact, when irony, reported speech, and other 
      meta-representational contents are taken into consideration, it becomes 
      apparent that communicators juggle quite easily with still more complex 
      meta-representations. This does not imply that communicators are conscious 
      of the complexity of their mental representations. What it does imply is 
      that every tier of these representations may play a role in inference. 
      Much of everyday communication takes place between people who are 
      benevolent to one another and who know one another well enough. In such 
      circumstances, cautious, and even naive optimism can serve as "default" 
      interpretation strategies, and the higher level meta-representational 
      tiers involved in sophisticated understanding may play no role at all. 
      Still, when the optimistic strategies fail, a competent hearer resorts to 
      the sophisticated strategy, and performs the complex meta-representational 
      inferences it involves, without the slightest difficulty.</P>
      <P>The ability to use such complex meta-representations is ignored in 
      psychology, where the study of much simpler meta-representation is a 
      relatively new topic. The logic involved in meta-representational 
      inferences is also hardly ever studied. Are humans intelligent enough to 
      know how intelligent they are?</P></FONT><!-- BEGIN MAILBANK COUNTER CODE --><IMG src=""> <!-- END MAILBANK COUNTER CODE -->
